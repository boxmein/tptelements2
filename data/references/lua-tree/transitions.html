<span id="properties.transitions">Transitions</span>
-----------

Transitions are really easy. Imagine you've got a line that you carefully split
into three sections: a middle where your element lives happily, and a lower edge
and a higher edge too, after which your element decides it doesn't stand the
heat or pressure anymore and transforms into another element.

Before we go on with the line theory, there's a few types of special definitions
in the C++ version you can use instead if you never want to transition to
another element at one point.

<span class="editable">IPL</span> = Impossibly Low Pressure (That Never Will Be Reached)
<span class="editable">IPH</span> = Impossibly High Pressure
<span class="editable">ITL</span> = Impossibly Low Temperature
<span class="editable">ITH</span> = Impossibly High Temperature
<span class="editable">NT</span> = No Type

Then there's the properties you need to change. There's two aforementioned "lines"
and a total of 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 properties we need to change. 


LowPressure keeps track of a lower limit of pressure: if the pressure around
this particle drops below LowPressure, turn this particle into
LowPressureTransition.

<span class="editable" id="properties.LowPressure">LowPressure</span> = IPL;
<span class="editable" id="properties.LowPressureTransition">LowPressureTransition</span> = NT;

HighPressure keeps track of an upper limit of pressure: if the pressure around
this particle drops below HighPressure, turn this particle into
HighPressureTransition.

<span class="editable" id="properties.HighPressure">HighPressure</span> = IPH; 
<span class="editable" id="properties.HighPressureTransition">HighPressureTransition</span> = NT;

LowTemperature keeps track of a lower limit of temperature: if the temperature
around this particle drops below LowTemperature, turn this particle into
LowTemperatureTransition.

<span class="editable" id="properties.LowTemperature">LowTemperature</span> = ITL;
<span class="editable" id="properties.LowTemperatureTransition">LowTemperatureTransition</span> = NT;

HighTemperature keeps track of an upper limit of temperature: if the temperature
around this particle drops below HighTemperature, turn this particle into
HighTemperatureTransition.

<span class="editable" id="properties.HighTemperature">HighTemperature</span> = ITH;
<span class="editable" id="properties.HighTemperatureTransition">HighTemperatureTransition</span> = NT;

For example, 

<span class="editable">LowPressure = -15.0f; 
LowPressureTransition = PT_DUST;</span>

means that an element will turn into dust at -15 pressure.

<span class="editable">HighTemperature = ITH; 
HighTemperatureTransition = NT;</span>

means that an element will not have an upper threshold. No temperature can be
bigger than ITH!
