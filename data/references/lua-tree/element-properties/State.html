<h2 id="properties.State">int State</h2>

<p>It's just a flag to tell which state the element's in right now, or even if it 
doesn't have a state. The only place I've seen it used so far is STKM figuring
out which particles it can spark...?</p>

<code class="nohighlight">(elements.)ST_SOLID = Solid
(elements.)ST_LIQUID = Liquid 
(elements.)ST_GAS = Gas 
(elements.)ST_NONE = None of the above.</code> 

<code>State = ST_SOLID;</code>
