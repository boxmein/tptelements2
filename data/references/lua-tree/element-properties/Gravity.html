<h2 id="properties.Gravity">float Gravity</h2>

<p>This determines how strongly gravity affects this particle. ANAR has this set as 
negative for example!</p>

<code><span class="comment nodash">// No effect</span>
Gravity = 0f; 
<span class="comment nodash">// Floats upwards at normal gravity's speed</span>
Gravity = -1f; 
<span class="comment nodash">// Floats downwards almost at normal gravity's speed</span>
Gravity = 0.999f;</code>
