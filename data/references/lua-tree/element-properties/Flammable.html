<h2 id="properties.Flammable">int Flammable</h2>

<p>How well this particle catches on fire. FIRE has a basic reaction in  which it
checks how flammable nearby particles are and uses that as a number to say how
quickly and how likely this particle will turn into fire. Particles are
entirely nonflammable at 0 and from there on become increasingly more
flammable.</p>
