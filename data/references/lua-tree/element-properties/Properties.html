<h2 id="properties.Properties">int Properties</h2>

<p>Every kind of element property other than the ones above. It's just a bunch of 
special flags that enable or disable things relating to this element. Some of
the things include whether you can 'paint' ctypes onto this element, whether it
can be 'painted' as a ctype onto other elements, stuff to do with neutron 
movements, etc.</p>
<p>If you want to use multiple at the same time, apply binary OR to them! Easy 
enough, right? </p>

<code>Properties = TYPE_PART | PROP_NEUTPENETRATE;</code>
