<h2 id="properties.Temperature">float Temperature</h2>

<p>The spawning temperature of this element. If you draw or create it in a standard
way then this is the heat the element will have once it's created. The value's 
in Kelvin though, so you'll have to convert if you don't like it. You could also
just do addition if you're in C++ or even Lua, it gets optimized out.</p>

<code>// #define R_TEMP 22.0f
Temperature = R_TEMP + 273.15f + 0.00f;</code>
