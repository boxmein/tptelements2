<h2 id="properties.HeatConduct">int HeatConduct</h2>

<p>Shows how well this particle transfers heat. In tpt.el.*, it's called hconduct
instead of heatconduct. You can use a value from 0 (none at all) to 255 
(really good). </p>

<p>INSL and FRME have this as 0. <br>
INSL/INST/HSWC and a few more have 251.</p>
