<h2 id="properties.AirDrag">float AirDrag</h2>

<p>How much air the particle "drags" along with itself when moving. CFDS is a 
magical constant that makes airdrag properly work with different pressure 
grid sizes. Thus the definition should always be multiplied by that.</p>

<p>For example,</p>
<code>AirDrag = 0.004f * CFDS;</code>
