<h2 id="properties.Name">string(4) Name</h2>

<p>This is the element's name outside the Lua API. It's what will be drawn on top 
of the element's button and what one will use to refer to the element in the 
exclamation-point command interface.</p>

<p>An example value could be:</p>

<code>Name = "BCOL";</code>
