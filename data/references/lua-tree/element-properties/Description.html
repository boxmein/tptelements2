<h2 id="properties.Description">const char* (or string) Description</h2>

<p>It's the text that the element shows when you put your mouse over its selection
button! Meant to be an element's description semantically speaking, however. So
use it as that :)</p>

<code>Description = "Broken Coal. Heavy particles. See COAL";</code>
