<h2 id="properties.Weight">int Weight</h2>

<p>Particle weight. A looong time ago there used to be a table that kept track
of what element sank under which and which it stayed on top of.</p>

<p>Below is an estimate to which range TPT's default elements' weights belong:</p>

<code class="nohighlight">
    1 = gasses.
    2 = very light powders. DUST?
 0-49 = liquids.
50-99 = default powders.
  100 = solids.
   -1 = energy particles (PHOT/NEUT/ELEC/PROT).
</code>
