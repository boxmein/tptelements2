<h2 id="properties.HotAir">float HotAir</h2>

<p>How much the particle increases the pressure around itself by, in order to 
simulate heating air around (this was made way before ambient heat). Another 
property that's mostly only used for gasses, but VENT/VACU have theirs at (-)0.010f. 
An extremely small number, sometimes as small as 0.000001f</p>

<p>Note: ICE has this as a negative value - it slightly reduces pressure!</p>
