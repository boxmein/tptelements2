<h2 id="properties.Explosive">int Explosive</h2>

<p>Sets default behaviour on if and how this element explodes. It works kind of
like C4 does: like burning except it spreads around very quickly, often in a
single tick, creating more pressure than normal. You can obviously do this in
your update code though...</p>

<code class="nohighlight">0 = no default explosion behavior.
1 = Explodes with fire.
2 = Explodes with &gt;2.5 pressure as well as fire.</code>
