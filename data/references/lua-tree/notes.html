<span id="notes">Notes</span>
-----

* The tree below is pretty packed with information. The doc has long lines so it
  is suggested that you disable word wrap.
* <span class="editable" id="boolint">boolint</span> = integer that acts as a boolean (0 or 1)
* <span class="editable">mixed</span> type means "whatever suits it there"
* If not explicitly noted, all color values have limits of <span class="editable">0 to 255</span> 
  (incl. firer/g/b, colr/g/b) and default to white.
* Extension to the above: all alpha values (firea/cola) have a limit of 100 as 
  the most opaque.
