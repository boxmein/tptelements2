# tptelements2

A bigger, better, faster, stronger, and overall cooler TPTElements. Written in
Node.js, using express.js :D

## Using the site

Look at `views/index.md`, which is literally the index page of the website
itself.

## Running

### Dependencies (I can hear you cheering already)

First and foremost, install some dependencies. I expect you already have Node.js
and Node Package Manager (npm) installed.

1. A SASS stylesheet compiler (I used compass, which is /technically/ a Ruby 
   thing). Get one here: http://sass-lang.com/install

2. A Jade template compiler

    npm install -g jade

3. The server's dependencies

    npm install

4. Ruby to run the Rakefile

### Setup

Now to do all the work to set up the project for first run. You need to assemble
the Lua reference from all its little pieces scattered around `data/references`.

Also, you need to compile the SASS stylesheets into usable CSS. To do these, if
you did install Ruby and Rake and Compass, you can do the following:

    rake

And that concludes setup.

### Actually Running The Code

Now that you've got your environment set up _just_ right, we need to run the
server! :D

To do that, enter the following command:

    npm start

And again, you're done. Magic, huh? 

## Developing

Sadly, you have to restart the server every time you modify server-side code, 
such as adding new routes or modifying route code.

However, you can modify Jade templates and stylesheets without restarting, and
what's even cooler, if you have Compass, you can run `compass watch` to 
automatically compile all your modified SCSS into CSS, which you can immediately
preview in the browser!
