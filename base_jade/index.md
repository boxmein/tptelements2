TPTElements is a website that helps you develop TPT elements with ease! 
Featuring a code editor with templates and snippets, and a bunch of references
to quickly lookup desired APIs!

In short:

Check out the [editor](editor) to try editing code. 

The editor helps you with code snippets as well as syntax highlighting. 
I'm in the process of adding API specific highlighting too. 

Until then, however, try double-clicking anything in the editor to see a short
description of it!
