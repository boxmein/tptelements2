============

A bigger, better, faster, stronger, and overall cooler TPTElements. Written in
Node.js, using express.js :D

Running
-------

First and foremost, install some dependencies. I expect you already have Node.js
and Node Package Manager (npm) installed.

1. A SASS stylesheet compiler (I used compass, which is /technically/ a Ruby 
   thing). Get one here: http://sass-lang.com/install

2. A Jade template compiler

    npm install -g jade

3. The server's dependencies

    npm install

4. Ruby to run the Rakefile
